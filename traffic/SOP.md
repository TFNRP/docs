# Radio Traffic

## Strict Radio Traffic

Within Strict RTO channels, unnecessary traffic may not be transmitted.

### Transmission Lifecycle

Your transmission must be immediately halted if a 10-3 is requested by dispatch.  
This is still applicable during self-dispatching.

#### Sending

If Signal 100 is active, you may only send priority traffic.

1. Wait for clear radio traffic;  
1. Callsign and addressed party stated;  
`"`[`One-King-Forty-One`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/metro/units.md#metro-area-platoon)` to Dispatch"`
`"One-Charlie-Thirty-Seven to Three-Charlie-Twelve direct"`
1. Wait for the response of stated party;  
`"Go ahead"`
1. Send traffic immediately, with codes used where applicable;  
`"`[`One-King-Tango-Twenty-Nine conducting`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/metro/units.md#metro-traffic-enforcement)` a `[`Ten-Eleven`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/traffic/codes.md#10-11)` on 5678"`
1. Wait for the response of stated party;  
`"`[`Ten-Four`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/traffic/codes.md#10-4)`"`
1. Repeat 4-6 until ended by a 10-4.

#### Receiving

1. Send response to sending party immediately;  
`"Go ahead"`
1. Wait for the traffic of the sending party;  
`"`[`Ten-Seventy-Three`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/traffic/codes.md#10-73)`"`
1. Send response traffic immediately, with codes used where applicable;  
`"`[`Ten-Eight`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/traffic/codes.md#10-8)`, `[`Ten-Seventy-Four`](https://github.com/TFNRP/docs/blob/main/traffic/codes.md#10-74)`"`
1. Repeat 2-4 until ended by a 10-4.

## Self-Dispatch

Whilst there is no available dispatcher on your radio frequency, self-dispatching is in effect.  

You should never assume if your frequency does not have an available dispatcher.  
You will know if self-dispatching is in effect once you have gone on duty.  

## Priority Traffic

### Definition

Emergencies that require immediate response, with the risk of harm or fatality of a peace officer or civilian.

### Operation

During the transmission of priority traffic,

1. the transmitter is not required to state their callsign or abide by strict radio traffic; and
1. all other radio traffic must cease, to allow the priority traffic to be clear.

However, the transmitter should state their location, and optionally callsign, for emergency response, if applicable.
